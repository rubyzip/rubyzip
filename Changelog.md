# 2.4.1 (2025-01-05)

*This is a re-release of version 2.4 with a full version number string. We need to move to version 2.4.1 due to the canonical version number 2.4 now being taken in Rubygems.*

Tooling:

- Opt-in for MFA requirement explicitly on 2.4 branch.

# 2.4 (2025-01-04) - Yanked

*Yanked due to incorrect version number format (2.4 vs 2.4.0).*

- Ensure compatibility with `--enable-frozen-string-literal`.
- Ensure `File.open_buffer` doesn't rewrite unchanged data. This is a backport of the fix on the 3.x branch.
- Enable use of the version 3 calling style (mainly named parameters) wherever possible, while retaining version 2.x compatibility.
- Add (switchable) warning messages to methods that are changed or removed in version 3.x.

Tooling:

- Switch to using GitHub Actions (from Travis).
- Update Rubocop versions and configuration.
- Update actions with latest rubies.

# 2.3.2 (2021-07-05)

- A "dummy" release to warn about breaking changes coming in version 3.0. This updated version uses the Gem `post_install_message` instead of printing to `STDERR`.

# 2.3.1 (2021-07-03)

- A "dummy" release to warn about breaking changes coming in version 3.0.

# 2.3.0 (2020-03-14)

- Fix frozen string literal error [#431](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/431)
- Set `OutputStream.write_buffer`'s buffer to binmode [#439](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/439)
- Upgrade rubocop and fix various linting complaints [#437](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/437) [#440](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/440)

Tooling:

- Add a `bin/console` script for development [#420](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/420)
- Update rake requirement (development dependency only) to fix a security alert.

# 2.2.0 (2020-02-01)

- Add support for decompression plugin gems [#427](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/427)

# 2.1.0 (2020-01-25)

- Fix (at least partially) the `restore_times` and `restore_permissions` options to `Zip::File.new` [#413](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/413)
  - Previously, neither option did anything, regardless of what it was set to. We have therefore defaulted them to `false` to preserve the current behavior, for the time being. If you have explicitly set either to `true`, it will now have an effect.
  - Fix handling of UniversalTime (`mtime`, `atime`, `ctime`) fields. [#421](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/421)
  - Previously, `Zip::File` did not pass the options to `Zip::Entry` in some cases. [#423](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/423)
  - Note that `restore_times` in this release does nothing on Windows and only restores `mtime`, not `atime` or `ctime`.
- Allow `Zip::File.open` to take an options hash like `Zip::File.new` [#418](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/418)
- Always print warnings with `warn`, instead of a mix of `puts` and `warn` [#416](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/416)
- Create temporary files in the system temporary directory instead of the directory of the zip file [#411](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/411)
- Drop unused `tmpdir` requirement [#411](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/411)

Tooling

- Move CI to xenial and include jruby on JDK11 [#419](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/419/files)

# 2.0.0 (2019-09-25)

Security

- Default the `validate_entry_sizes` option to `true`, so that callers can trust an entry's reported size when using `extract` [#403](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/403)
  - This option defaulted to `false` in 1.3.0 for backward compatibility, but it now defaults to `true`. If you are using an older version of ruby and can't yet upgrade to 2.x, you can still use 1.3.0 and set the option to `true`.

Tooling / Documentation

- Remove test files from the gem to avoid problems with antivirus detections on the test files [#405](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/405) / [#384](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/issues/384)
- Drop support for unsupported ruby versions [#406](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/406)

# 1.3.0 (2019-09-25)

Security

- Add `validate_entry_sizes` option so that callers can trust an entry's reported size when using `extract` [#403](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/403)
  - This option defaults to `false` for backward compatibility in this release, but you are strongly encouraged to set it to `true`. It will default to `true` in rubyzip 2.0.

New Feature

- Add `add_stored` method to simplify adding entries without compression [#366](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/366)

# 1.2.3

- Allow tilde in zip entry names [#391](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/391) (fixes regression in 1.2.2 from [#376](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/376))
- Support frozen string literals in more files [#390](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/390)

- Add changelog entry that was missing for last release [#387](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/387)
- Comment cleanup [#385](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/pull/385)

# 1.2.2

# 0.5.10

- Fixed method name resolution problem with FileUtils::copy_stream and IOExtras::copy_stream.

# 0.5.9

- Fixed serious memory consumption issue

# 0.5.8

  Zip::ZipFind.find traverses into zip archives too.

# 0.5.0a

Source reorganized. Added ziprequire, which can be used to load ruby modules from a zip file, in a fashion similar to jar files in Java. Added gtk_ruby_zip, another sample application. Implemented ZipInputStream.lineno and ZipInputStream.rewind

Bug fixes:

- Read and write date and time information correctly for zip entries.

# 0.1.0

- First working version of ZipInputStream.
