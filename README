= Documentation

There is more than one way to access or create a zip archive with
rubyzip. The basic API is modeled after the classes in
java.util.zip.* from the Java SDK. This means there are classes such
as Zip::ZipInputStream, Zip::ZipOutputStream and
Zip::ZipFile. Zip::ZipInputStream provides a basic interface for
iterating through the entries in a zip archive and reading from the
entries in the same way as from a regular File or IO
object. ZipOutputStream is the corresponding basic output
facility. Zip::ZipFile provides a mean for accessing the archives
central directory and provides means for accessing any entry without
having to iterate through the archive. Unlike Java's
java.util.zip.ZipFile rubyzip's Zip::ZipFile is mutable, which means
it can be used to change zip files as well.

Another way to access a zip archive with rubyzip is to use rubyzip's
Zip::ZipFileSystem API. Using this API files can be read from and
written to the archive in much the same manner as ruby's builtin
classes allows files to be read from and written to the file system.

The samples/ directory is a good place to start to get a feel for
using the library. For details about the specific behaviour of classes
and methods refer to the test suite. Finally you can generate the rdoc
documentation or visit http://rubyzip.sourceforge.net/doc.
